#### GHFollowers ü´ô

GHFollowers is an iOS app that allows a user to search for GitHub users, and browse their followers.

It was originally a [take home project](https://seanallen.teachable.com/p/take-home) from Sean Allen, I added additional features and refactored the project.  

- Architected with MVVM-C, using Combine to bind between View and ViewModel
- Developed listing, searching and filtering followers features within the view
- Implemented remote image caching natively with NSCache for SwiftUI Image to save network resources
- Adopted Swift Concurrency (async/await) pattern for asynchronous event handling
